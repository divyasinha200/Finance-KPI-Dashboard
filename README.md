## 👩‍💼 Business Analyst Role

### 🧩 Business Problem

The company's management team was struggling to monitor sales performance effectively. Reports were generated manually using spreadsheets and emails, which were time-consuming and delayed. There was no simple way to compare *actual sales vs. target sales*, or to understand which teams or individuals were underperforming — especially across different time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

This made it difficult for decision-makers to take timely action or adjust strategies.

### 💡 My Role as a Business Analyst

As a Business Analyst, I stepped in to:

- Understand the key business goal: Track sales performance and identify gaps
- Define KPIs with clear business value:
  - Total Sales (Actual)
  - Total Sales (Target)
  - Variance and % Variance
  - YTD Sales
- Collaborate with the dashboard design to ensure it answered business questions like:
  - Who is underperforming?
  - Are we meeting our targets monthly and quarterly?
  - Which teams need support?

I also summarized findings into clear, business-focused insights.
